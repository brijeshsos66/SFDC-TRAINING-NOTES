AccountTeams:
---------------------
	1. On Account we can have only user as owner.
	2. If you want group of users to collaborate and work more effectively, then we use AccountTeams.
	3. Every AccountTeamMember will have role assigned.
	4. AccountTeamMember will get access on Account record and corresponsing child opportunites, cases.
	5. Every user can view one default AccountTeam.
	6. Steps to enable AccountTeams:
		Setup:
		----> Build
			----> Customize
				----> Account
					----> AccountTeams
						----> Enable
							----> Add then PageLayout
	7. Test
		Open any one of the Account Record Detail Page.
		Add TeamMember from the default Team.
	8. How to create account default Team.
		Setup:
		----> Administer
			----> Manager Users
				----> Users
					----> Account Default Team
						----> Add the users
	
PageLayouts:
--------------
	1. This will specify how an object should be visable to a profile.
	2. This will control
		a. Fields
		b. Order of the fields
		c. Visability of the fields
		d. Buttons
		e. Related List
		f. Fields in the related list
	3. Every profile by default will have one pagelayout.
	4. When we create custom object, salesforce automatically create one standard PageLayout with name of
	   CustomObjectName+'Layout'
	   Example:
		  Object Name			PageLayout
		  Customer				Customer Layout
		  Loan__c				Loan Layout
	
	Date Security Model:
	--------------------
	1. Object Level Security
		a. Profile Level Security
		b. Permission Set
	
	2. Record Level Security
		a. OWD (Organization Wide Default)
		b. Role Hierarchy
		c. Sharing Rules
		d. Profile and Permission set view All
		e. AccountTeams
		f. Opportunity Teams
		g. Case Teams
		h. Territories Level Security
	
	3. Field Level Security:
		a. Profile
		b. Permission Set
		c. PageLayout
		d. RecordType
		
	1. Object Level:
	-----------------
		a. Object Level permissions are controlled by profile.
		b. Profile will decide what CRUD operations user perform on the object.
			Example:
			a. Create a custom object: Customer
				Field Name				Datatype
				Name					AutoNumber CID{000}
				LastName				Text
				First Name				Text
				Phone					Phone
				City					PickList (Hyd, Ban, Che)
			b. Create a Tab for a Object.
			c. Create a Profile: Recuriter
				
				a. Grant Read, Create access on Customer Object.
			
			d. Create a user wilson, with recuriter profile and see what operation he can perform on customer.
		c. Permission Set:
			1. Using Permission set also we can control the access on the object.
			Example:	
				a. Create a Permission set Recuriter Permissions.
				b. GoTo object settings
					1. Enable Read, Edit, Delete on Customer Object.
				c. Assign this permission set to the wilson and check the access on the object.

Record Level Access:
----------------------

OWD: Organization wide default settings
1. This will specify minimum level of access that every user has on the record.
2. There are six types of OWD:
	a. Private
	b. Public Read
	c. Public Read/Write
	d. Public Read/Write/Transfer
	e. Public Full Access
	f. Controlled by Parent
3. On a record we can perform Read, Edit, Delete, Transfer.
4. Example: Customer Object
	CustomerId		Owner
	-----------------------------
	C001			Sam
	C002			Ram		
	C003			Kiran
5. OWD: Private :
	a. If you define owd as private on a object, only owner can access the record and no other user can see the record.
	b. Owner can perform Read/Edit/Delete/Transfer operation on the record.
	Example:
			LoggedIn			Records
			----------------------------------------------
			Sam					C001---Sam: R/W/D/T
			Kiran				C003---Kiran: R/W/D/T
6. OWD: Public Read :
	a. If you define OWD as Public Read on a object, Every user can access every record in the object.
	b. Owner can perform Read/Edit/Delete/Transfer on the record.
	c. Other user can only read the data from the record.
		Example:
		
		LoggedIn			Records
		---------------------------------------------------
		Sam					C001---Sam    : R/W/D/T
							C002---Ram    : R
							C003---Kiran  : R
		
		Kiran				C003---Kiran  : R/W/D/T
							C001---Sam    : R
							C002---Ram    : R
		
7. OWD: Public Read/Write
	
	a. If you define OWD as Public Read/Write on a object, Every user can access every record in the object.
	b. Owner can perform Read/Edit/Delete/Transfer on the record.
	c. Other user can only read and write on the record.

	Example:
	
	LoggedIn			Records
		---------------------------------------------------
		Sam					C001---Sam    : R/W/D/T
							C002---Ram    : R/W
							C003---Kiran  : R/W
		
		Kiran				C003---Kiran  : R/W/D/T
							C001---Sam    : R/W
							C002---Ram    : R/W

8. Public Read/Write/Transfer : 
	a. This permission can be given only on Lead and Case object.
	b. If you define OWD as Read/Write/Transfer, every user can access every record in the object.
	c. Owner of the record can perform Read/Edit/Delete/Transfer operation on the record.
	d. Other users can perform Read/Edit/Transfer operation on the record.
	
		Example:     Lead
		
		FirstName		Owner
		------------------------------------------
		Satish			Kiran
		Ramesh			Prasad
		Naveen			Ram
		
		LoggedIn		Records
		------------------------------------------
		Kiran			Satish---Kiran  : R/W/D/T
						Ramesh---Prasad : R/W/T
						Naveen---Ram 	: R/W/T
		
		Ram				Satish---Kiran  : R/W/T
						Ramesh---Prasad : R/W/T
						Naveen---Ram    : R/W/D/T

9. Public Full Access:
	a. This is available only on campaign object.
	b. If you define OWD as public Full Access, every user can access every record and perform R/W/D/T on every record.

10. Controlled By Parent:
	a. When two objects are connected by Master-Detail relation, child object will have owner field.
	b. When we select controlled by Parent, owd applied on master object will be applied on child object.
	
11. Navigation:
	Setup
	----> Administer
		----> Security Controllers
			----> Sharing Settings
				----> OWD
					----> Edit
	
12. Grant Access Using Role Hierarchy:
	a. If you enable this option, all the users who standing above you in role hierarchy, can access all the records that 
		are visible to you.
	b. All the users who are standing above you can perform read/write/delete/transfer operations on those records are accessible
		to you.
	c. By default this option is enabled on all standard object.
	d. On Custom objects we can enable or disabled the option, based on the requirement.

13. Profile Level : View All and Notify All
--------------------------------------------
	View All : If you define view All permisssion on a object for a profile.
			   All users with this profile can perform read operation on every record.
	ModifyAll : If you define modify all permission for a profile.
				All users with this profile can perform read/write/delete/transfer operation on every record.
	Modify All Data: If you enable this option for a profile, all the users with the profile can see every 
					 record in every object in the organiztion and perform Read/Edit/Delete/Transfer operations.
	View All Date : If you enable this option for a profile, all the users with profile can see every record
					in the organiztion and perform Read.

14. Sharing Rules:
------------------
	a. These are used to grant extra access on the records apart from what user is already able to see using OWD.
	b. There are four types of sharing rules:
		a. Owner-Based Sharing Rules
		b. 

Field Level Permission:
------------------------

	1. Profile Level
	2. Permission Set
	3. PageLayout
	
	Visable 			ReadOnly
	-----------------------------------------
	Ok					NO           ---Read/Write
	Ok					Ok			 ---Read Access
	NO 					Ok			 ---Not Allowed
	NO					NO			 ---Not Visable

   a. Field Level Security is defined with the combination of PageLayout and profile.
				Profile								PageLayout
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Visable			Read					Visable				Read
		------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		No 				No						Yes					No 			---Not Visable
												Yes					Yes			---Not Visable
												No 					No			---Not Visable
		
		Yes				No						No					No			---Not Visable
												Yes					No 			---Read/Write
												Yes					Yes			---Read
		
		Yes				Yes						No 					No			---Not Visable
												Yes					Yes			---Read
												Yes					No			---Read
		
		Note: At the time of creating of field if we define field as required, then it will be required on all the pagelayouts.
		
		Note: At the time of Creating a pagelayout if we define field as required it is required on only on that particular field as required.
