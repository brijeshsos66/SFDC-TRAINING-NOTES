	AND ( ISNEW(),
		  CloseDate < TODAY()
		)

Task:
------
	1. It is standard object.
	2. It is a part of Activites.
	3. Any work assigned on the record will be stored as Task.
	4. When we want to create a task we should know:
		a. To whom we are assigning.
		b. What is the due date.
		c. On which record we are assigning.
		d. What is the status of the task.
	5. Task can be assigned on any object which has allow activites options enabled.
	6. Allow Activites option is by default enabled on every standard object,
				On Custom object it is optional.
	7. Task can be assigned to User, Owner, Role.
		a. If a task is assigned to a user, he will be the owner of the task.
		b. If a task is assigned to owner.
			1. Is owner is a user, then task is assigned to user.
			2. If owner is a queue, User who intiated the operation will be the owner of the task.
		c. Is task is assigned to role, if only one user has this role, if only one user has this role, then this user will be the 
		owner of the task.
		d. If the task is assigned to role, if there are more than one user with same role, Owner of the record will become 
		owner of the task.
	8. Tasks which are assigned to the user are visable on the home page as MyTasks.
	9. On the detail page of the record we find the tasks assigned under open activites.
	
	Exmaple 1:
	Task:
	Object				: Lean
	AssignedTo			: User : Wilson
	Name				: Schedule Appointment
	Due Date			: 10 Days from Trigger Date
	Status				: Not Started
	Priority			: Normal
	
	
	Setup
	----> Build
		----> Create
			----> Workflows and Approvals
				----> Tasks	
					----> New Task
	
	Workflow : 1
	Object 		: Lead
	Rule Name 	: Corporate Leads
	Evaluation	: Created
	Rule		: Rating Hot and Lead Source is Web
	Actions		: Immediate Actions
	
	Task		: Assign Existing Action : Schedule Appointment
	Setup:
	----> Build
		----> Create
			----> Workflow and Approvals
				----> Workflow Rules
					----> Continue
						----> New Workflow Rule
							----> Select the object with whom you want to create the workflow
								----> Next
									----> Give the Workflow Name
										----> Evalution Criteria
											----> Give some Rule Criteria
												----> Save
	Now, we have to create the workflow rule, criteria to do some action.
													----> And remember to activate it

Field Update:
-------------

	1. When a condition is met, if you want to system to update the value of a field, then we use field update action.
	2. Using the field update action we can modify the fields of the record and its master record fields.
	3. Steps to create field update action:
		Setup:
		----> Built
			----> Create
				---->Workflows and Approvals
					----> Field Update
		
		Step 1: Enter Action Name
		Step 2: Choose the object
		Step 3: Choose the field
		Step 4: Set the value
		Step 5: Save
	4. Example 1:
		a. Field Update Action:
			Action Name 			: Rating Update
			Object 					: Lead
			Field					: Rating
			Choose PickList			: Hot
			save.
		b. Create a workflow :
			Rule Name				: Lead Rating Update
			Object					: Lead
			Evaluation				: Created 
			Rule					: Lead Source=Web
			Action					: Immediate, Choose from Existing Action 
									  Rating Update
			Click on Done
			Click on Activate
		c. Create a Test Record on the Lead with LeadSource at web check the raitng value.
	
	5. When we have workflow rule with multiple field update actions, then field update actions will be executed in the 
		order of field update action created date.
	Example 2:
			a. Field Update Action 1:
				CreatedDate			:	10-Aug-2018	:10:20 AM
				Object				:	Account
				Rule Name			:	First Action
				Field				:	Description
				Value				:	This updated with first action
				
			b. Field Update Action 2:
				CreatedDate			:	10-Aug-2018	:10:30 AM
				Object				:	Account
				Rule Name			:	First Action
				Field				:	Description
				Value				:	This updated with second action
			
			c. Create Workflow Rule:
				Rule Name			:	Multiple Actions
				Object				:	Amount
				Evaluation			:	Created
				Rule				:	Industry=Banking
				Action				:	Immediate Actions add the existing actions in the order of
										Action 2
										Action 1
			
			d. Testing
				1. Click on Account tab and create new Account with following data
					Name		:	Wipro
					Industry	:	Banking
					Rating		:	Hot
					
				save the record
		
		o/p: Wipro---Banking---Hot---This update with Action
	
	6. When we have multiple workflow rules on the same object, then actions will be performed.
	7. When we have multiple workflow rules defined on the same object, all the rules are verified first then actions
	   are performed next as per workflow created date.
	   
	   Example 3:
		a. Workflow			:	1
			CreatedDate		: 	10-Aug-2018:10:30 AM
			Name			:	First
			Object			:	Account
			Rule			:	Industry=Banking
			Action			:	Immediate Choose from Existing Action 2.
			
		b. Workflow			:	2
			CreatedDate		: 	15-Aug-2018:10:30 AM
			Name			:	Second
			Object			:	Account
			Rule			:	Rating=Hot
			Action			:	Immediate Choose from Existing Action 1.
			
		c. Workflow			:	3
			CreatedDate		: 	17-Aug-2018:10:30 AM
			Name			:	Third
			Object			:	Account
			Rule			:	Rating=Ward
			Action			:	Immediate Choose Field Update Rating=Cold.
		
		4. Test it :
		Click on Account Tab, Create a new Account with following data
		
			Name		:	Wipro
			Industry	:	Banking
			Rating		:	Hot
			
			Execution:
			
				Wipro---Banking---Hot
				Step 1: Check all the rules : WR1: true, WR2: true, WR3: false
				
				Step 2: Collect the actions of those rules which are true
						WR1 : Action
						WR2 : Action
				
				Step 3: Run the actions as per the order of Workflow created date
				
					First set WR1 Action: Wipro---Banking--Hot---This is Second Update
					Second WR2 Action	: Wipro---Banking--Hot---This is first Update
				O/P: Wipro---Banking---Hot---This is second Update.
	
	8. Re-evaluate the workflow rule after field Changes:
		a. If this option is enabled, if there are any field update due to the workflow rule,
			it will re-check the remaining rules which are failed in the earlier steps.
			
			Example 4:
			1. Field Update		:	Action 1
			   Object			:	Account
			   Field			:	Ownership = Private
			   Re-evaluate		:	False
			  
			2. Field Update		:	Action 1
			   Object			:	Account
			   Field			:	Ownership = Private
			   Re-evaluate		:	False
			   
			3. Workflow			: 1
			   CreatedDate		: 10-Aug-2018:10:30 AM
			   Name				: First
			   Object			: Account
			   Rule				: Industry=Banking
			   Action			: Immediate Choose from Existing Action 1
			  
			   Workflow			: 2
			   CreatedDate		: 15-Aug-2018:10:30 AM
			   Name				: Second
			   Object			: Account
			   Rule				: Ownership=Private
			   Action			: Immediate Choose from Existing Action 2
			   
			Testing : Create
				Name	:	Wipro
				Industry:   Banking
				Ownership:	Public
				Rating	:
				O/P:  Wipro---Banking---Private
			
			Note: GoTo Action 1 and enable this Re-Evaluate Workflow
				Create a Test Record
				Name	:	Wipro
				Industry:	Banking
				Ownership:  Public
				Rating:
				O/P: Wipro---Banking---Hot
			
Email Template:
---------------
	Setup
	----> Administer
		----> Communication Templates
			----> Email Template
				----> New Email Template
	
	Step 1: Choose the template type
	Step 2: Enter Template Name
	Step 3: Enable Available for Use
	Step 4: Create the subject
	Step 5: Create the body of template
	
	Example 1:
	1. Create a Email Template
		Name					:	Lead Acknowledgement
		Available for Use		: 	Yes
		Subject					: 	Lead Confirmation
		Body					: 
		<!--
			Dear (!Lead.FirstName),
			Thanks for showing interest on our products,
			My Agent will getback to you in 48 working hours.
			We have received following details
			Name	:	(!Lead.FirstName) (!Lead.LastName)
			Phone	: 	(!Lead.Phone)
			Email	:	(!Lead.Email)

Time-Dependent Workflow Actions:
---------------------------------
	1. When the condition and criteria is met action will be automated by the workflow rules.
	2. If you want action to be performed at a specific time then we go with time based workflow actions.
	3. Time Based workflow actions are performed when the evaluation criteria is:
		a. Created
		b. Created and any time edited to meet the criteria.
	4. If you want to define Time-based actions, we have to create Time Triggers.
	5. Time Triggers will specify at what time actions should be performed.
	6. Time Trigger will be formed using the Date or DateTime fields of the object, with before or after given
		no. of days or hours.
	7. We can define 10 time triggers for a workflow.
	8. In each time trigger we can have 40 different actions.
	9. Out of 40 actions:
		Email				: 10
		Fields Updates		: 10
		Task				: 10
		Outbound			: 10
	10. How to track the Time-Based Workflow actions.
		Setup
		----> Monitor
			----> Time-Based -Workflow -Actions
				----> Give a condition
					----> Track the status
		
		Example:
		Workflow Rule:
			Object			:	Oppourtunity
			Name			:	New Oppourtunity
			Evaluation		:	Cretaed and Any time edited to subsequently meet the criteria.
			Rule			:	CloseDate != today
			Action			: 	Time Based Action
			Time Trigger	:	3 days before CloseDate
							:	Action	: Task
								Assign To Owner
		Test:
		Create a new Oppourtunity
			Name			:	Admin
			CloseDate		:	18-JAN
			Stage			:	Prospect
			Type			:	New Customer
		
		Navigate to
		Setup
		----> Monitor
			----> Time-Based-Workflow-Queue
				----> Condition
						Object = Oppourtunity
						
		We are supposed to choose one of the user as default workflow user.
