Formula
-------
a. It is a datatype.
b. This datatype is used when we want the system to generate the value based on the business logic.
c. There are 2 types of it:
	1. Simple Formula
	2. Advanced Formula
d. Simple Formula:
	If you want to wrtie a simple rule using the fields of the record, with simple operators we will use simple formula.
e. Advanced Formula:
	If you want to write complexed rule, using the fields of the records, and its master fields using the pre-defined functions we will go for advanced formula.
f. Every formula we write in the salesforce will give you result in the form of:
	a. CheckBox
	b. Currency
	c. Date
	d. DateTime
	e. Number
	f. Percent
	g. Text
	h. Time
g. Pre-defined functions:
	a. TODAY() : This will return the today date.
	b. NOW()   : This will return current date time.
	c. MONTH(date) : This will return month in the given date.
	d. YEAR(date)   : This will return Year in the given date.
	e. DAY(date)   : This will return day in the month.
	f. DateValue(datetime) : This will return date from the datetime.
	g. TimeValue(Date/Time): This will return time from Date and Time: HH:MM:SECS:MSECS
	h. HOURS(Time) : This will return hours.
	i. WEEKDAY(Date) : This will return day in the week.
	Monday: 0, Sunday: 1, &.., Saturday : 7
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	ISNULL(value) : If value if NULL, it will return true.
					This is used for numerical fields.
	ISBLANK(value) : This will return true, if the value is blank.
					 This is used for text field.
	SYNTAX: IF(cond,value1,value2)
	-------------------------------
	If the cond is true, value1 is given and else value2 is given.
	
	(Q)
	Object: Lead
	Return: Number
	Rule  : Field Name            ISNULL/Blank         NotBlank/NotNull
			Email                 0                    10
			Phone                 0                    10
			FirstName             0                    10
			AnnualRevenue         equals to zero 0 points, more than zero 20 points.
			
			Email: cts@gmail.com   10
			FirstName = cts        10
			AnnualRevenue = 25     20
	(A) using IF conditional
	
			IF(ISBLANK(Email), 0 ,10) + 
			IF(ISBLANK(Phone), 0 ,10) +
			IF(ISBLANK(FirstName), 0, 10) +
			IF(AnnualRevenue > 0,20, 0)
    
	(Q) Use Case 2
	Object: Lead
	Fields: Rating
	Rule :  LeadScore          Rating
			10 				   1 star
			20				   2 star
			30				   3 star
			40 				   4 star
			50				   5 star
			
	IMAGE( 
CASE( Revenue__c , 
50, "/img/samples/stars_500.gif ", 
40, "/img/samples/stars_400.gif", 
30, "/img/samples/stars_300.gif", 
20, "/img/samples/stars_200.gif",

"0 stars")
	
	UseCase: 3
	Object: Oppourtunity
	Field : Age
	Rule  : This will calculate how many days back the record was created.
	
	(A) TODAY() - DATEVALUE(CreatedDate)
	
	UseCase : 4
	Object : Loan__c
	Fields: FieldName       DataType
			Type			PickList -- Housing, Personal, Vehicle.
			Security		PickList -- Salary, Assert
			AppliedDate		Date
			AppliedAmount	Currency  1000
			AsserCost		Currency
			
			Formula:
			1. Calculate the rate of interest
			Rule : Type      Interest
				   Education  12%
				   Housing    10%
				   Personal   11%
				   
			CASE(Type__c,
				'Education',0.12,
				'Housing',0.10,
				'Personal',0.11,
				0
				)
				
			
		    2. Calculate the no. of EMI's
			Rule:  Type      EMI
				   Education  48
				   Housing    120
				   Personal   32
				   
			CASE(Type__c,
				'Education', 48,
				'Housing', 120,
				'Personal', 32,
				0
				)
		
			ISPICKVAL(PickList, value):
			This will return true, if the option what we have selected in the picklist fields is same
			literal what we have given.			
	
	3. Create Formula to calculate the max sanctioned amount
	Rule:    Security is salary and type is education 24 times of 80% of salary
			 Security is salary and type is housing 80 times of 60% of salary
			 Security is salary and type is Personal 20 times of 40% of salary
		
	Example: ISPICKVAL(City__c, 'Pune')
	
	IF(ISPICKVAL(Security__c, 'Salary'),
	  CASE(Type__c,
		'Education', 24*0.80*salary__c,
		'Housing', 80*0.60*salary__c,
		'Personal',20*0.40*salary__c,
		0
		),
		AssertCost__c*0.60
		)

	4. Create a formula to calculate interest
		
		(SanctionedAmount * NoOfMonths/12 * rate)
		
	5. Calculate the total amount
	
		SanctionedAmount + Interest
	
	6. Calculate EMI
	
		Total / NoOfMonths

Rollup - Summary:
---------------------
	1. This field can be created only on Master object in Master-Detail relation.
	2. This is used to create Aggregate operations on corresponding child records.
	3. Aggregate functions can be:
		a. count : This will return count of the no. of record participating in the relation.
		b. Sum(field): This will return summarized value of given field from the coreesponsing child records.
					We can perform this operation on Numerical, Currency, Percent.
		c. Min(field): This will return minimum value of given field from the corresponding child records.
					We can perform this operation on Numerical, Currency, Percent, Date, DateTime.
		d.Max(field): This will return maximim value of given field from the corresponding child records.
					We can perform this operation on Numerical, Currency, Percent, Date, DateTime.
	4. We can specify which child records should be part of rollup-summary.
		a. Include all the child record in the operation:
		If you choose this aggregate operation will be performed on all the child records.
		b. Include only those child records which are meeting the given condition.
	5. We can create 25 rollup summary fields on the object.
	UseCase :
		1. Create Custom Object : Loan
		2. Create the following fields:
					Field Name        Datatype
					LNO               AutoNumber
					Type              PickList ( Education, Housing)
					Customer Name     Text
		3. Create a Custom Object : Payment
		4. Create the following fields:
					Field Name		  DataType
					PaymentId		  AutoNumber
					Amount			  Currency
					Mode			  PickList ( Online, Cash)
					Loan			  Master-Detail (Loan)
		5. Create RollupSummary Field
		Object				: 	Loan
		Field Name			:	Total Amount
		Child Object		: 	Payments
		Operation Type		:	Sum(amount)
		Which Records		:	All Child Records
		
		6. Create RollupSummary field
		Object 				: 	Loan
		Field Name			:	Total Online Amount
		Child Object		: 	Payments
		Operation Type		:	Sum(amount)
		Which Records		:	Only those payments records whose mode of payment is Online.
		
		7. Create RollupSummary field
		Object 				: 	Loan
		Field Name			:	Total Cash Amount
		Child Object		: 	Payments
		Operation Type		:	Sum(amount)
		Which Records		:	Only those payments records whose mode of payment is Cash.
