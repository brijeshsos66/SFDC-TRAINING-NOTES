Relations:
---------------
	1. Relations are used to establish connection between two or more objects.
	2. There are five types of relations:
		a. Lookup Relation
		b. Master-Detail Relation
		c. Many-to-Many Relation ( junction object)
		d. Hierarchical Relation
		e. External Lookup Relation
	3. Lookup Relation:
		a. Lookup Relation is a datatype of a field.
		b. We can create lookup field on Standard Object and Custom Object. 
		c. We can create lookup field on the object which contains the data and which doesn't contain the data.
		d. It will create one-to-Many relation between the object.
		e. Object on which we have lookup field, that object is called child object.
		f. Object to whose data lookup field is referring that object is called Parent object.
		g. Lookup field is a optional field.
		h. Lookup fields will store Id of the parent record.
		i. We can create self lookup.
		j. If you delete the parent record, lookup field value is kept as blank.
		k. If you don't want parent record to be deleted when it has a child, then enable the option of don't 
			allow deletion of parent when it is a part of lookup relation.
		l. Lookup filter, this will specify which records of the parent should be displayed on the pop-up window.
		m. Maximum number of lookup relations what we can create are 25, directly or indirectly we can have 40
		relation on a object.
		n. Standard lookup fields which are created in salesforce:
		
		Parent Object				Child Object			Lookup Field Name
		------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Account						Contact					Account
		Account						Opportunity				Account
		Account						Case					Account

		Standard				Custom				Allowed
		Custom					Standard			Allowed
		Custom					Custom				Allowed
	
	4. Master-Detail Relation : 
		a. It is one-to-many relation.
		b. We will create one-to-many relation using Master-Detail datatype.
		c. This field can be created only on Custom object.
		d. Master-Detail is a required field (Mandatory field by default)
		e. Master-Detail field can be created only on those custom object which doesn't contain the data.
		f. Master-Detail field can be created master-detail field that object is called child/detail object.
		g. Object to whose date we are  referring that object is master object.
		h. Which of the following statements are true ??
		
		Parent				Child				Status
		------------------------------------------------------
		Standard			Standard			Not Allowed
		Standard			Custom				Allowed
		Custom				Standard			Not Allowed
		Custom				Custom				Allowed
		
		i. 	Object on which we have created master-detail field, that object will not have any owner field.
		j. Owner of the master record, should be the owner of the child record.
		k. When we delete a master record, corresponding child records are also deleted.
		l. When we undelete the master records, corresponding child records are also undeleted.
		m. Master-Detail field will store the 18 character Id of the master record.
		n. We can create two master-detail fields on the object.

		s. Sharing Settings:
		This will specify which user can perform Craete/edit/Delete/Read operation on corresponding child record.
			1. Read Only: If you choose this option, All the users who have minimum read access on ,master record can perform Read operation
						 on the corresponding child records.
			2. ReadWrite: If you choose this option, All the users who have minimum readwrite access on ,master record can perform Create/Edit/Delete/Read operation
						 on the corresponding child records.
		
		t. Allow Reparenting:
			If you enable this option, child can change it's parent.
		
		5. Junction Object(Many-to-Many Relation)
			1. Any Custom object with two master-detail fields on it is called Junction Object.
			2. It will maintain Many-to-Many Relations.
			3. First Master-Detail field is called primary Master.
			4. Second Master-Detail field is called Secondary Master.
			5. Who ever is the owner of the primary master, he will be owner of the corresponding child records.
			6. If you delete any one of the master-record, corresponding child records are deleted.
			7. Junction object cannot be parent to any other object.
		
		6. Hierarchical Relation:
		--------------------------
			1. This can be created only on user object.
			2. This is used to create one to one relation.
			3. This will create the relation between user to user.

		Q: How to create Master-Detail field on custom obejct which already contains the data.
		Example: Customer
				Payment Object : 5000 records
			
		Requirements: Create a Master-Detail field on Payment Object with Customers as Master.
		Step 1: Create a lookup field on the Payment object choosing Customer as parent.
		Step 2: GoTo every record on the payment object and assign parent lookup field.
		Step 3: Change the datatype from lookup to master-detail relation.
		Note: If you have large amount of data in the child object, then we use ETL tools to upload the data.
